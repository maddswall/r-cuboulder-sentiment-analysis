The UCB wireless wifi is best for loading videos, anything on your computer, canvas, or anything that needs a steady connection that may be a lot of data to load.

Eduroam is good for gaming but it’s also inconsistent as hell.

If the WiFi stops working, disconnect and reconnect and UCB wireless will start working again"

If they actually tried you can have a network that can serve up to 1000+ devices in each dorm but they have other priorities I guess. Even the wired has problems, in that it's completely unsecured, to the point where I was able to stream from my PC to at least three random Xbox Ones that were also on the wired network.

31,dflspt,If you switch between them enough times the internet works,2019-10-09 19:11:31,Problem with upgrading that infrastructure is that a government organization is going to be so slow to maneuver and so wishy-washy and cheap that it's not worth the multi-year investment for many providers to go after it. My father is the CEO of a company that does gigabit+ connectivity for enterprise/residential and he said they're not interested in a college application because the process would take too long.

174,dpb355,What to do with a billion dollar budget,2019-10-30 19:00:20,"nah it's cool hellems doesn't need updating let's build another buff pool.

fuck the humanities students"
175,dpb355,What to do with a billion dollar budget,2019-10-30 19:00:20,"Econ, Gugg, Edu, Hellems, Duane G Wing, Armory"
176,dpb355,What to do with a billion dollar budget,2019-10-30 19:00:20,"Alright - I did undergrad here and then came back to work and have been in different staff leadership positions on campus for about 7+ years now. I agree 100% that at times the priorities of the campus look straight up BIZARRE.  I had the same thoughts when I was a student and as a staff, I have thought that as well. 

As I've worked here longer, I've been able to understand where all this $1b+ budget goes to and why we seem so slow to make changes.  First of all, what everyone needs to know about higher education is that about 95% of the budget every year is already spoken for and committed.  Predominantly (about 90%) of that amount is from and goes towards SALARIES for faculty and staff.  When we hire a new faculty member who is a tenure-track member, we are committed a salary line for on average about 30 years.  That's $100k+ (don't forget expensive benefits costs) for three decades.  Now multiply that by hundreds and that's without looking at staff.  Much of our staff is ""at-will"" meaning we could part with them at any time, but they all serve a vital purpose on campus to keep this place running.  There's another group of staff that are classified state staff and they're much more difficult to separate from.  We see a lot less movement there.  

The money about I'm speaking about is also nearly all of it is general fund money.  This is money that comes from tuition, fees, and breadcrumbs from the state (we're rock bottom in the US in state ranking of state support and have been for years).  The Lemon Spa Water, while it may be tasty, comes from a different bucket of money.  Housing and Dining is what is considered an ""Auxiliary"" which means they actually receive zero money of the budget I mentioned above.  An auxiliary by campus definition is a department that generates and creates its own revenue, and excess revenue is sucked back into the University at the end of the year.  So in a roundabout way, it makes it back to the same pool as ""general fund"" but it's not a straight line.  What many departments do before sending that money back is spend on other things that general fund depts would not otherwise do, and that's stuff like Lemon Spa Water.  They have a level of flexibility and spending ability that is unmatched by general fund.  

So why don't they spend that money on new dorms, you ask?  Because that's where auxiliaries have to play by different rules - capital governance.  Which a heinous, grotesque bureaucratic process to do any renovation or new build.  There's a massive prioritization process on campus and with the Regents to determine which buildings are the ripe for this change and need it the most.  Dorms are put in the same prioritization list as Hellems and other classroom buildings, and departments that are able to go get private funding (aka Aerospace Engineering) are able to get their project prioritized because they are asking for less of the capital budget or that leftover 5% that the University has flexibility with each year.  

I probably missed something in this long ass early morning post, but the short of it is that CU and other public higher eds have big processes that go through regents and stakeholders, etc. are routinely tied up in budget.  Also, most of this campus was built with asbestos so there's a BIG abatement and cost to any old building renovation (like hellems).

Happy to answer more if anyone has any"

225,cwvvt6,sHArE tHe rOaD,2019-08-29 04:16:28,"It's because dismount zones are completely counter intuitive. The dismount zones are there because they're crowded areas. The areas are crowded because there's a lack of free space. But getting off your bike causes you to take up twice as much space, leading to even more crowding and even slower walking traffic. It's better for pedestrians trying to get to class if bikers pull their back break and travel at walking speed on their bike."

Benefits:

1. I’m covered from hail

2. When my class decides to have a test that starts at 7pm, the busses no longer run when I’m leaving at 8:30, so I’d have to Uber, now I just drive home.

3. I work on campus so I can grab food for lunch.

4. I’m not restricted to someone else’s schedule. (When I took the bus last year I’d leave my apartment at 7:10 to make my 8 am class. Now I can leave at 7:40 and still make it)

It may be expensive, but the benefits outweigh the cost for me."

394,9tqocs,"Chad, I don’t feel so good...",2018-11-03 02:40:20,The university can always put out emails about the situation. The fact that they don't warn students about cults recruiting on campus or frats that are common places for girls to get drugged is mind boggling. Yet we get emails about a dude who was stealing panties out of a laundry room.

413,dowy1a,From the MAN himself,2019-10-29 21:53:23,Yea im pretty sure thats why there was a late start on Monday. The snow was no big deal but it was <10 degrees so they pushed back the start time. Id guess we have a late start again tho as the school seems hesitant to cancel a full day.
414,dowy1a,From the MAN himself,2019-10-29 21:53:23,I think it’s cause the power was out in a lot of buildings.

I think they didn't want themselves falling on their ass to be on the record. Also sorry this video is so glitch, it's two years old, been stored on google cloud, and was re-encoded to aggregate like 5 different 10 second snapchat videos."

But it always broke my heart when I saw her falling asleep trying to swipe someones card, I really hope CU takes care of her retirement. "

It's weird because 1.) why tf are you here if you're going to do that 2.) it's rude as hell to the prof and the students around you and 3.) everyone does it so it makes me question if *I* am in fact the weirdo for, like, engaging in class"

I’ll be on the way edge of the sidewalk, hardly taking any room, and then a biker will squeeze between me and the grass on the side. Um, what the fuck.  I find that walkers at CU Boulder also don’t realize we live in the USA. For some reason, 75% of you walk on the left side of the sidewalk. I’m not sure if you guys haven’t noticed, but we don’t live in Europe. You walk on the right side, not the left. Finally, I find that almost all walkers don’t understand the concept of sharing space. I’m trying to ride up a sidewalk ramp, and these kids are taking up every foot, so I have to hop of my board instead. "

750,6x21fb,I Fucking Hate Skateboarders On This Campus,2017-08-30 20:37:59,"**Demagogue**

A demagogue  (from Greek δημαγωγός, a popular leader, a leader of a mob, from δῆμος, people, populace, the commons + ἀγωγός leading, leader) or rabble-rouser is a leader in a democracy who gains popularity by exploiting prejudice and ignorance among the common people, whipping up the passions of the crowd and shutting down reasoned deliberation. Demagogues overturn established customs of political conduct, or promise or threaten to do so.

Demagogues have appeared in democracies since ancient Athens. They exploit a fundamental weakness in democracy: because ultimate power is held by the people, it is possible for the people to give that power to someone who appeals to the lowest common denominator of a large segment of the population.

You guys are super cool, keep up the good work :)",2019-11-21 19:02:59,"Vast majority of “skaters” on campus literally just picked up the sport. You can always tell by the way  kids push mongo, can’t Ollie over a curb, don’t know how to slow down properly and are overall just very reckless riders. The kids who can actually skateboard well are typically good about staying out of the way"

And we mute the alarm immediately so it’s easier for us to clear the buildings. While we do that we call the alarm company and they legally have to mitigate the problem immediately. So I’m guessing this story is zero true.

907,dkdfe3,You fuckers wanna stop setting off the fire alarm,2019-10-20 02:08:42,"Thanks for your input! Let me explain since you don't believe me. 

Some dilhole sprayed the detector directly with an ABC fire extinguisher. The fire alarms in those buildings used particulate detectors. Since the extinguisher is chemical based, it coated the particulate detector with a fine mist of particulates. Since the fire department couldn't clean out the detector, it was continually detecting that there were particulates, causing a bunch of false alarms.

Of course when the department came out, they muted as they cleared the building. But when they left, they'd unmute it. Shortly after they left, (you guessed it) the alarm would re-activate, they'd get called again, and we'd have to re-evacuate.

So don't believe me if you want, but it happened."
908,dkdfe3,You fuckers wanna stop setting off the fire alarm,2019-10-20 02:08:42,"Your first comment was about a fire alarm- which are audio and visual, this post says ‘the detector’, which is a completely different part of the fire alarm system. So you could imagine the confusion and doubt. And yes I know how photoelectric smoke detectors work. The ‘fine mist’ is either sodium bicarbonate or monoamodiumphosphate. Neither of which are the fire departments responsibility to clean out, nor would we try. The fire alarm company can deal with that. We will, however, keep responding every time the alarm is triggered because that’s the contract with the fire alarm company (and in this case the city of Boulder)."

One person doing blackface in their free time is not “racism in public institutions” simply because they go to a public university.

While you put forth what seems to be a decent argument, I really don’t think all your wordiness is to a point. In the end of the day, you all seem to be arguing that the government be more restrictive of what you’re allowed to say and do. Take a step back and look at the Whitehouse. Do you see how maybe the government being that in control of people isn’t the best of ideas? My argument is centered on individual liberty. By saying, “the government should...” you’ve just pawned of what is your responsibility and prerogative as a citizen to an inefficient, ineffectual, often corrupt system that is not aligned with your best interests."

We only offer the first 6 sessions free but we can help you find someone outside of CU. Are you interested in that? I said yes.""

I met with CAPS the following week and we called my insurance together to find therapists in the area who took my insurance and I probably called and messaged like 15 people in my own time after that and I think only 2 got back to me saying they could take me and took my insurance. It took about 2 weeks for me to find a therapist who had availability and took my insurance (3 weeks from my first time at CAPS) and I've been seeing the therapist I found for about a month now and I really like her.

&#x200B;

I find it rich that he said he supports the LGBTQ community, but after cutting women's ice hockey at North Dakota, he called women's hockey a ""boutique sport."" [Grand Forks Herald - April, 14, 2017](https://www.grandforksherald.com/sports/4250377-update-attorney-findings-prior-athletics-cuts-deemed-confidential) (near the bottom).

&#x200B;

He has more recently been under criticism for [originally giving his chief of staff a $30,000 per year raise and a $25,000 per year travel allowance to to commute from Texas](https://www.sayanythingblog.com/entry/und-plans-to-spend-up-to-25000-per-year-letting-chief-of-staff-work-from-home-in-north-carolina/) after she decided move out of North Dakota. He since ended that arrangement, but [then told the Daily Camera](https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4598016-hogwash-kennedy-comments-draw-wide-criticism-community-state) that the criticism he received was due to his chief of staff being black and a female. There was also his [friend who got $17,250 per month](https://www.sayanythingblog.com/entry/longtime-friend-of-und-president-got-17250-per-month-salary-for-part-time-job-plus-expenses-to-commute-from-boston/) for a part-time job and travel expenses to commute to ND from Boston.

&#x200B;

I outlined more personal experiences of his tenure in a [letter I posted on Twitter back when he was a presidential finalist at Central Florida last year](https://twitter.com/rladue/status/964300752947687424). I'm not trying to gain clicks, but I implore every one in the system to read it, to get a better idea of what to expect from Mark Kennedy. [Direct link to image of letter](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWHiZQmUQAAZFct.jpg:large).

&#x200B;

TL:DR

I worked at North Dakota under Mark Kennedy. He is not just a terrible President, but also a terrible human being. He blocked me on Twitter for posting honest and truthful criticism about him."

So would a (very) liberal nominee go over well at CU Colorado Springs? The Board of Regents (5 Republicans vs 4 Democrats) was unanimous in its recommendation, so maybe we should also find out why he's a good candidate according to the nine regents.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, this guy doesn't seem like a great choice to me at all, and the selection process has not exactly been transparent, just don't forget to look at it from somebody else's perspective too. And if you really want change, one Republican regent's term ends this year (3rd district), and another's ends two years after that (6th district).

1077,bc42fq,Stand Up for CU,2019-04-11 19:30:33,"I think you’re missing the point of the poster.

The poster is criticizing the fact that a nominee who is clearly strongly conservative is being appointed to represent a student body, the majority of which does not agree with Kennedy’s views. 

An A+ from the NRA typically implies that this nominee would be in favor of extremely-lax gun regulations and restrictions, which is not implied to be a bad thing, but it is implied that this conflicts with the beliefs of most of the student body. 

Also, keep in mind that an A+ from the NRA does not necessarily only mean pro-second-amendment, it means that this person goes above and beyond in defending guns from any sort of regulation. 

For example, I believe that citizens should have the right to own firearms. However, I believe that no citizen (active-duty military and other government agents excepted) should be in possession of an assault weapon, as I believe these weapons are entirely unnecessary for any civilian purpose (hunting or sport-shooting) and that the government has a demonstrable interest in restricting ownership of these weapons to maintain public safety. I’m absolutely positive that if I were a representative, the NRA would rate me at an F, even though I support the right to own firearms, because I’m against people owning assault weapons, the explicit purpose of which is to kill large quantities of people. 

This example is not meant to start a political argument on gun ownership, but it is meant to demonstrate to you why an A+ from the NRA would be seen as a bad thing by many people, and why a lower grade from the NRA wouldn’t necessarily mean that your gun ownership is threatened.

In the midst of all these other low scores from pro-civil-rights organizations, I don’t think an A+ from the NRA would compensate regardless of whether or not that rating is a good thing."

Bizarre; CU makes its grad student workers pay fees to maintain the campus (read: build more athletic/recreational spaces) and you *support* making it harder for them to keep the money they earn? This President, who has produced nothing of any scholarship whatsoever, will be paid handsomely to keep the people who want the fruit of their own labor from keeping it.

Also the NRA does not support the second amendment. They support making it easier for people to sell guns irresponsibly; they’ve made no efforts whatsoever to establish laws by which militias may be maintained and may have control over such firepower as to threaten tyranny from the federal government. But even if they did, there is no ideological inconsistency in supporting some rights over other rights; the constitution was written by men, not handed down by God.

I’m talking about the fact that

Which should be clear from what I wrote. Since the new president of CU is anti-union we can expect more hostility in collective bargaining to bring about the end of the circumstance that

>	CU makes its grad student workers pay fees to maintain the campus.

Now as for the second point, *you* seem to be “all over the place” since you have not responded to my criticism that the NRA makes no effort to establish powerful well-regulated militias in the US, which as you’ll note if you read the Consitution is a crucial element in the purpose of the Right to Bear Arms. We would expect an organization ideologically committed to that amendment to do more than deregulate the arms trade; but, and this is where you get “all over the place,” the deregulation of the arms trade does not follow directly as a goal of a second-amendment-supporting institution and I’m not interested in whether the decrease in gun-related deaths should encourage us to deregulate the arms trade because, unlike you, I am trying to stay on-topic."

Human rights are as such objective, and any good legal system, insofar as it exists, should try to ensure that everyone is granted human rights (supposedly by creating a notion of legal rights which are designed to align with human rights).

Your ""human rights are subjective"" thing is a view called ""cultural moral relativism."" There are a lot of reasons to think it's incorrect, one of which you actually highlighted --- the fact that genocide is terrible regardless of what the law or a given society says about it.

Yes I'm ignoring them because those sorts of arguments are irrelevant, disingenuous, and purposely designed to waste time while skirting the real issue of Kenndey's nomination.

Could it have anything to do with the fact that 13%... more like 8%... of the population, being black males, commit 50% of the crime? Go have a look at table 43 there genius. It's almost like the prison population is EXACTLY representative of who is committing crime."
1200,dc2owm,"Also, buff bus bad",2019-10-02 00:36:07,"Not true, because white men are statistically just as likely to commit crimes as black men—only they don’t get caught, or aren’t convicted because their police system doesn’t systematically target them.

By the way, 13/50 is a favored white nationalist talking point."

Even after adjusting to account for the academic abilities of students when they entered these majors, the study found that business and education majors still showed substantially lower gains in writing, complex reasoning, and critical thinking by the time they’d graduated.

We all pay for the class right? But someone who didn’t plan their schedule well enough to get from class to class disrupts me and everyone else because of their poor planning and they think they’re not a dick.

1605,cztfe6,I feel bad for contributing to the waste,2019-09-05 00:33:35,"Definitely a frustrating issue at CU! The Environmental Center and other important players in sustainability are aware of this issue, but right now it's simply a matter of cost. It's simply too labor-intensive to keep compost bins everywhere on campus, not to mention that the nearest compost facility is some distance away.

If it's any condolence, the Environmental Center does run its own recycling center, and although it is likely to lose money this year due to the collapse of the recycling market, the Environmental Center will always support you recycling anything you can.

Of course, the main solution to both composting and recycling is to use less - so challenge yourself to bring more tupperware, reusable water bottles, etc!"
1606,cztfe6,I feel bad for contributing to the waste,2019-09-05 00:33:35,The UMC has compost. Sometimes the Laughing Goat does. Not convenient if you're far away but I will drop stuff off there when I can.
1607,cztfe6,I feel bad for contributing to the waste,2019-09-05 00:33:35,"Also, most Residence Halls with a Dining Hall in it (or grab 'n go/market) have access to compost bins. They will gladly take your compost during working hours, provided you talk to them. Engage with your Dining Hall employees/attendants, they will help if they can."
1608,cztfe6,I feel bad for contributing to the waste,2019-09-05 00:33:35,I think it’s hard to have compost everywhere but I also do believe that if they did more recyclable things instead of the compostables it would be recyclable plastics. Hopefully the Environmental center is able recover as well.

I relish the thought of being in the so-called Professor's shoes, sans 'both of you' comment, herding her through the door quietly as it dons on me that I'm simply dealing with a spazzed-out mind and words have no meaning here. Nodding quietly, arms lateral like Jesus, a serene expression on hale complexion. Eyes, seemingly shut, really just open enough to see the shrieking bleached little meteor scurry off.

In all seriousness though, she is almost certainly exhibiting paranoid-schizoid traits, [Heavy](https://heavy.com/news/2019/10/rebekah-krajacic/) has an article with the most info on Rebekah Krajacic (please share this woman's name), including some of her Facebook ramblings.  Just topped Google a few minutes ago.

The man who stands accused (and clearly is completely vindicated by her extensive history of accusing strangers and exes of stalking), should be applauded and looked-towards for his restraint and response in all of this. In his shoes, I highly, highly doubt I would have been as measured or restrained. ""I'm superior to you"" is exactly right. You are in every way brother."

1638,df25dj,We have a winner /s,2019-10-08 16:11:33,"Insultingly flaunting your relative societal status to a disrespectful person sure doesn't make that person any less disrespectful. In fact it reinforces it. 

What you morally panicked virtue signallers are missing here is that in the realm of an altercation, both people can contribute to it's escalation and equally to it's deescalation. Yes, viewing the world through a morally binary lens is easy, and makes you look like a hero to your equally uninformed friends, but it is not accurate whatsoever. 

The woman is a racist that shouldn't be racist, and the guy here could learn to take care of situations like that with more composure."
1639,df25dj,We have a winner /s,2019-10-08 16:11:33,"I fail to see why the burden of ""taking care of situations like that with more composure"" is being placed on the person being called the n word. Your statement that ""both people can contribute to it's escalation and equally to it's deescalation"" assumes that both people have the goal of deescalation and are working in good faith. I agree that its easy to view the world through a morally binary lens, but ignoring nuance in favor of generalist statements is disingenuous at best. 

As to why he was saying he is superior: because the language she uses is evocative of hundreds of years of a social system in which people of darker skin were treated as gross inferiors to those with white skin. We know of her socio-economic status now, after this incident - in the context of what transpired in the altercation (a conversation between two presumed students), I think his language is acceptable."
1640,df25dj,We have a winner /s,2019-10-08 16:11:33,So basically you’re saying black people need to be nice to those who call them the n word. Bad argument dude.

-When I do UMC is the best. 

-When I did:

#1 Farrand -  Burgers (especially the special like the sunrise burger) and Quesadillas (Thursday’s)

#2 UMC 

#3 C5C - even though I lived in Libby was sometimes worth it because of selection and less crowds 

#4 WeatherTech Cafe - use your much money the best way possible 

#5 C4C Grab and Go took be the longest to try but was surprisingly really good and you got a lot of food for one swipe

If anyone is interested about cults, I highly recommend the book Combatting Cult Mind Control by Steven Hassan. If you want to know more about cults, or know someone who is in a cult, this is the book for you. This book contains information on what makes a group a cult, how cults recruit members, and how to help someone disengage from cult. If you're in a group accused of being a cult, this book will allow you to determine once and for all whether you're in a cult or not. If you're not in a cult, then you have nothing to fear as this book will give you clear criteria of what makes a group qualify as a cult, none of which would apply to your group. Also, it's a good read (or listen, if you're into audiobooks)."

Had 3 Nebraska fans a couple of rows in front of me in the student section enjoying minimal abuse all game long. Just saying no outside fan, much less a corn fan, should ever feel comfortable being in our student section. Would like to see us step up a bit."

They appear in natural systems due to movement through least resistance and designing a system that needs to move anything (like sidewalks carrying people) is difficult because of it. Desire Paths will arise if they are more efficient and should be learned from so that future systems can be designed better. I remember hearing of a building built on a college campus recently that had various tunnels built into the structure to retain the optimal pathing, and I love it.

EFFICIENCY"

1978,al9x2z,What a night.,2019-01-30 06:27:52,"Incredible that we had such a similar experience. I was taking the bus home after a long session of partial derivative play with Daddy Becker in his ECOT office, and I too noticed this drop dead gorgeous girl. Being the only alpha male in sight (thankfully far away from Leeds) I knew i should make a move. Alas, right as I was about to ask her what her favorite CU chancellor was, the willVille bus flew around the corner, killing a student in the crosswalk. Perplexed, we both entered the bus. I sat near the bus driver because I have to make sure he’s on point, and she sat near the handicapped seat facing towards me. In the back was a strange man wearing two hats, holding a leash that led to the collars of three individual dogs, ranging from sizes small to medium. At one point I realized she was staring straight at me, so I went to tell her a story of my time in Iraq. All I could mutter was “four score and seven years ago” when she suddenly ran off the bus. I was in deep pursuit when I slipped on a particularly nasty piece of ice. I thought all Hope was gone, but when I looked up, there she was. We made love that night, but after climax, I realized she was actual just three small men in an lifesize AirPod costume. I was devastated. I still haven’t taken the bus to this day. "

2016,74cpj6,Has a single sign ever been so ignored by so many?,2017-10-05 01:16:58,They need to be bike lanes like other parts of campus. Sorry but don't expect people to get off their bikes three separate times on their way from the hill to the engineering center. 
2017,74cpj6,Has a single sign ever been so ignored by so many?,2017-10-05 01:16:58,It bothers me that the past year I had no trouble riding down that hill from Umc to the physics building. I personally don’t think it takes that much thought for any student to not mow down people in the busy times.

2032,74cpj6,Has a single sign ever been so ignored by so many?,2017-10-05 01:16:58,The smoking ban on campus is a CU regulation and has no legal repercussion same with the dismount zone.

Same with vaccines. Herd immunity is incredibly important for people who are unable to get them due to legitimate, medically-approved reasons. By not getting vaccinated, you are not only putting yourself at risk for NO good reason,   but also presenting a clear and present danger to the lives of others.

2187,58vgiw,The BUFFS are BOWL ELIGIBLE for the first time since 2007 UPVOTE PARTY!!!!,2016-10-22 21:57:03,"Technically,  you can also score 2 points in 2 other ways besides a safety.  The defense can block the extra point (1 point for the offense if successful) after a touchdown (6 point score), and if they return it the length of the field,  they will be awarded 2 points.  

The other way would be if you choose to ""go for 2"" after scoring a touchdown on offense, and instead of kicking an extra point,  you try to run or throw the ball into the end zone again. 

However,  you can't get these 2 points without first getting the 6 points from scoring, so Stanford could not get to 5 points this way. They got a field goal,  3 points and then a safety, 2 points,  to achieve their final,  measly score of 5 points. "

2194,d5ocvy,Resurrection Church at Norlin Library,2019-09-17 22:30:17,"Fun fact: When culty churches send members into environments they know will be hostile (like liberal college campuses), the goal is not really to convert students. The goal is to put the evangelist themself through an uncomfortable ordeal, so they'll come back and bond with other cult members about how scary the outside world is, and thus will want to spend more time inside the safe cocoon of the cult, and less in the outside world. 

So, look, you don't owe them anything, and you can't be expected to try and save them. But if you run into an evangelist on campus and you're in the mood to engage them, instead of arguing religion with them (somebody else will do that), tell them why they really got sent out there. They won't believe you, but maybe it'll plant a seed."

The best Indian food is in Louisville, Thai food is so comically hit or miss I don’t even want to dive into it, west end is literally the only BBQ place worth going, we’re a brewery city at best. Foodie city is so incorrect it makes me want to fly to San Francisco to suck a homeless dude’s dick just to get some exotic flavor.

2415,9gz4jr,Ring ring on your left,2018-09-18 21:46:08,The thing that drives me crazy in Boulder is the lack of enforcement of bikes not following road rules. I grew up in Aurora and one of our neighbors cycles on the road and he got a ticket for not stopping at a stop sign there. Not once during my time at CU did I *ever* see a cop stop a bike for doing something illegal. (Same goes for pedestrians...did you know it's a $50 fee if you cross the road without pressing the flashy light crossing beacons? Never seen that enforced)

I've seen plenty of them break laws, even run red lights in front of cops, and they do nothing. Hell, I got a $300 ticket because I took a legal U-turn and a guy on a bike ran a red light and fell over trying to avoid hitting me right in front of a cop. The cyclist screamed and hollared at the cop, who immediately gave me a ticket and refused to listen to my side of the story, or apparently even justly enforce the fucking law."

2420,9gz4jr,Ring ring on your left,2018-09-18 21:46:08,"You said crosswalk, I explained that crosswalks aren't for bikes. How is that pedantic? The EB/WB crosswalks on 28th have lower elevation than the vehicle lanes. You can't see a biker in the crosswalk there if you're turning from the frontage road until they're less than a second from you. If they're in the lanes, you have about a four to eight second warning, which is plenty. Not to mention that hill down Colorado can easily let a cyclist get up to 25 MPH, 30-35 on a quality road bike. Just because you *can* go that fast doesn't mean it's within the mechanical limitations of your bike's brakes."

A lot of the time TA's do the grading and evaluating for classes, so getting on their radar (positively!) can be a very good idea.

The third, the teacher only allowed laptops on the first three rows, and I sat in the middle of the lecture hall with my laptop wide open.

MAKE friends early, even if some of those friends have local friends.  Everyone is meeting new people but it is up to YOU to be bold and brave and invite yourself.  Don't get upset if you don't get invited if you didn't even let them know you are interested.  I got too wrapped up in my new roommate and missed out on some early connections and know I have to make more of an effort.  Second, you DON'T have to completely furnish your dorm at once.  Don't get too many containers.  The closets are pretty big and you need less than you think you do.  I did get a kettle and a couple of containers but it was much better to ease into it.  So many people get too much and throw stuff away.  And yes, go to class and go to tutoring and ask questions before you get behind. Figure out the resources available and use them.  Schedule them in your day.  Finally, go to the activity fair and get involved in a club or activity outside of your major or just something you like to do.  I am so glad I do a sport and meet people outside of my major.  Oh and learn how to use the bus as soon as you can as it is Freedom and better than dealing with a car."

If you want to do research, each department has its own site where you can read through what each professor is working on. If one of your professors is doing something that interests you, you could go to office hours, introduce yourself, and talk to them about it. Also consider DLA/SPUR.

Almost as intense as the time I was relaxing in the Mackey Auditorium, preparing for a show I had later that week. I went to sit near the middle right seats, to see what perspective my parents would have as they watched me aggressively blow into a piece of wood for an hour. I heard a slight creak in the background but ignored it as I was stuck thinking about Bernie Sanders. All of a sudden, the ghost of Alfred Packer sat down in the seat next to me. I was like, ""Oh shit what's up aren't you that cannibal guy."" He told me not to worry about my recital, and that even if I failed, or ate another human, they might name a grill in the UMC after me. I was so reassured I immediately shot up and decided today was the day to get hit by the Buff Bus. "
